LEVELS:
apparent 3
chain 3
all loops, including TUTORIAL
a final boss
research TUTORIAL, make score constraint shiny, max instead of min producers or consumers

are you sure button


# Menu
make icons for reversing drag direction

# TESTS
add nodes and links and make sure adjacency is correct
also make sure undoing and redoing keeps this correct
to test layout, add nodes and links and make sure stress is lower than a certain amount
double check the score for certiain combinations too
automated random graphs to test for no NaN

check all UI.Image components to make sure they have materials
check all serializefields to make sure they are not null

# Research world
fix superfocus small nodes
make leaderboards more explorable
finish the tutorial for this as well.
verify high scores by checking matrices

# Other
do cholesky instead of SGD
center the status bars, but attach them with an offset to species world position
score explanation and show highest on tap (or make it blink?)
fix health and traits rendering beind and hide if empty tap and make pretty and hide and on finish
double check the teams visualisations (better constrain for trophic, procrustes for nontrophic)
more fidelity in link balls
masks on menu screen
remove/disable layout groups as soon as levels are spawned
remove animators from all UI (especially in menu)
release game with australian fires as angle?

experiments to see how the score changes over time

This level is the same as the last, but this time you are only allowed one plant.
This level gives you a species of weight 8 again, but this time you are only allowed one plant.This level is the same as the last, except that this time you cannot add an extra plant to make the heavy speces survive. See if you can still save it!
