DO THIS NOW:
(CV) ecobuilder lol

ECOBUILDER:
fix superfocus small nodes
make SGD a coroutine for webgl
add imperial logo with permission

# LEVELS
research TUTORIAL!!! (give option to skip tutorial by performing some action)
do high scores for heavy 3
some final bosses

show global high score at all times in research world (only up to top 1000, which should be sustainable)
(stars will have to be removed from the level as well as the report card)

check that score encryption is okay

# TESTS
to test layout, add specific nodes and links and make sure stress is lower than a certain amount
but also automated random graphs to test for no NaN

make sure web_gl is same as not web_gl (conditional compiles)

use reflection to smell the smellylisteners
check all levels to see if their parent variant is base, and if their flavour texts are not 'TODO'

# Research world
verify high scores by checking matrices

# Other
make health go blue if above a super threshold (will need another fill sprite)
release game with australian fires as angle?
experiments to see how the score changes over time

I have read
I understand the purposes
I consent to data

# REPORT CARD
Your final score was XXX
Use the 'i' icon thingy to show the explanation This was made up of X nodes, and X edges
The species with the... is...
(extra info on click such as stability (eigenvalue), nonreactive)
