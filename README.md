LEVELS:
some final bosses
research TUTORIAL!!!, make score constraint shiny

are you sure button
fix help text on constraints
do procrustes for SGD layouts

# TESTS
add nodes and links and make sure adjacency is correct (check for nulls and not nulls in nodes and links)
also make sure undoing and redoing keeps this correct
to test layout, add nodes and links and make sure stress is lower than a certain amount
double check the score for certiain combinations too
automated random graphs to test for no NaN

check all UI.Image components to make sure they have materials
check all serializefields to make sure they are not null
check all levels to see if their parent variant is base, and if their flavour texts are not 'TODO'
check for any TMPro.TMP_SubMeshUI scripts

# Research world
fix superfocus small nodes
SAVE PROGRESS?
verify high scores by checking matrices

# Other
make leaderboards more explorable
send data while not connected
health and traits hide if empty tap
more fidelity in link balls
remove/disable layout groups as soon as levels are spawned
make health go blue if above a super threshold (will need another fill sprite)
release game with australian fires as angle?

experiments to see how the score changes over time

# REPORT CARD
Your final score was XXX
Use the 'i' icon thingy to show the explanation This was made up of X nodes, and X edges
The species with the... is...
(extra info on click such as stability (eigenvalue), nonreactive)
