LEVELS:

research TUTORIAL!!!

(make health bars colour in based on rise or fall)

fix superfocus small nodes
do procrustes for SGD layouts

send data collected while not connected
only grab leaderboards that we need (but always median)
make leaderboards scrollable

# TESTS
add nodes and links and make sure adjacency is correct (check for nulls and not nulls in nodes and links, and in graveyard) (also check constraint calculations)
also make sure undoing and redoing keeps this correct (check adjacency before and after)
to test layout, add nodes and links and make sure stress is lower than a certain amount
double check the score for certiain combinations too
automated random graphs to test for no NaN

check all UI.Image components to make sure they have materials
check all serializefields to make sure they are not null
check all levels to see if their parent variant is base, and if their flavour texts are not 'TODO'
check for any TMPro.TMP_SubMeshUI scripts
check that all UI navigation is disabled
use reflection to smell the smellylisteners

# Research world
SAVE best level config? Could take from server?
verify high scores by checking matrices

# Other
health and traits hide if empty tap
make health go blue if above a super threshold (will need another fill sprite)
make shade a global thing (with a stack) because it's stupid to have it everywhere
release game with australian fires as angle?
make nodelink tooltip do something more flashy when links are added and removed

experiments to see how the score changes over time

# REPORT CARD
Your final score was XXX
Use the 'i' icon thingy to show the explanation This was made up of X nodes, and X edges
