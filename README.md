LEVELS:
apparent 3
chain 3
all loops, including TUTORIAL
a final boss
research TUTORIAL, make score constraint shiny, max instead of min producers or consumers

are you sure button


# Menu
make icons for reversing drag direction

# TESTS
add nodes and links and make sure adjacency is correct
also make sure undoing and redoing keeps this correct
to test layout, add nodes and links and make sure stress is lower than a certain amount
double check the score for certiain combinations too
automated random graphs to test for no NaN

check all UI.Image components to make sure they have materials
check all serializefields to make sure they are not null

# Research world
fix superfocus small nodes
make leaderboards more explorable
finish the tutorial for this as well.
verify high scores by checking matrices

# Other
do cholesky instead of SGD
center the status bars, but attach them with an offset to species world position
score explanation and show highest on tap (or make it blink?)
fix health and traits rendering beind and hide if empty tap and make pretty and hide and on finish
double check the teams visualisations (better constrain for trophic, procrustes for nontrophic)
more fidelity in link balls
proper outlining (add another simpler mesh as outline within the same sprite. Links can be done in the shader)
masks on menu screen
batch levels on menu together by only adding a canvas when it is in card mode (as before lol)
remove/disable layout groups as soon as levels are spawned
remove animators from all UI (especially in menu)
release game with australian fires as angle?

experiments to see how the score changes over time

# REPORT CARD
Your final score was XXX
This was made up of X nodes, and X edges
The species with the... is...
(extra info on click such as stability (eigenvalue), nonreactive)
