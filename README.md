ECOBUILDER:
write a cover letter

make incubator appear ahead of statusbars?
add 'please wait while loads' and imperial logo onto splash images
constraints touch release

introduce superfocus earlier than research world!
always remove any double touch in one frame (two fingers bad)

text input at login can be buggy on tap or not on tap
add a hint text that comes up after 2/3 minutes for each level
double tap name to change name, and limit its length to 255 chars
ask samraat to remove the TODO
give extra information for heaviest level
give a reminder for which one is apparent and which is exclusion - add a glossary as a hyperlink
mention the speed of the link balls going is important
the incubator may stay open when it shouldn't sometimes - the trigger is not being used when undo and delete at same time also check redo and undo spamming with incubator, level 9 (can have more species than allowed?)
species is deleted and spawned at the same time

make level 9 easier - it's a little hard to figure out, or give a better hint?
level 10 might be too hard as well
the model calculation may not run sometimes - see pamela's screenshot
sound effects! and some relaxing music
instead of going grey, reserve the first third of the bar for extinction, and make it go yellow/red depending on extinction (like a phone battery bar)
level 13: test if 3 stars is possible

# TESTS
make sure web_gl is same as not web_gl (conditional compiles)
check all sprite atlases

use reflection to smell the smellylisteners
alt tabbing out of application could break graphinteraction?

# Research world
verify high scores by checking matrices

# Other
change press/tap to hold/click based on platform
release game with australian fires as angle?
experiments to see how the score changes over time

I had my first heisenbug today! async trophic levels

# REPORT CARD
Your final score was XXX
Use the 'i' icon thingy to show the explanation This was made up of X nodes, and X edges
The species with the... is...
(extra info on click such as stability (eigenvalue), nonreactive)
